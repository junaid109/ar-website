Welcome to my Augmented Reality Glasses website mock design! This website was built using React JS and Tailwind CSS, and was designed to showcase a futuristic line of augmented reality glasses.

The website features a sleek and modern design, with dynamic animations and high-quality images that showcase the capabilities of the glasses. Users can browse through different models of the glasses, view detailed product information, and even visualize how the glasses would look on their own face using the augmented reality feature.

The use of React JS allows for a highly responsive and interactive user interface, while Tailwind CSS makes styling and customization of the website simple and efficient.
